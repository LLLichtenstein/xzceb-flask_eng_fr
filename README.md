## Final Project for Course 7 - Python Project for AI & Application Development - of the IBM Cloud Full Stack Developer Certificate

You are working for an IT services company and your company has just won a big project with an hotel in Quebec, Canada serving customers with a large French-speaking population. While most communication will happen in English, there is a scope for personal touch if French is used in communication. You are going to develop some chatbots for the client. The chances that the customer base the client is dealing with is largely French-speaking is high. So you would like to develop a server with end points that allow you to translate from English to French and from French to English.

You are given a skeleton structure, on top which you are expected to build the functionality.

Prework: Sign up for IBM Cloud Lite account and create a Watson Language Translator service.

Create an IBM Cloud Lite account, if you don't have one already.
Create an instance of the Watson Language Translator.
Create Python Server side

Fork and clone the skeleton project on your GitHub.
Create an instance of the Watson Language Translator in the translator.py
Create two functions, one to translate from English to French and the othet to translate from French to English in translator.py
Write unit tests to test the two functions
Run coding standards check against the two functions
Run unit tests and ensure the tests pass.
Package the above functions and tests as a standard python package
Import the package in server.py. Create two end points in server.py /englishToFrench and /frenchToEnglish and test them on local server.
Deploy the application on IBM Cloud.
Deploy the server application

Deploy the server application so that it is accessible through browser
